# group-project-comp229

This is our GitHub repo for COMP229 Group 2 Project.

## The following are instructions on how to contribute to the project.

If you arent already familiar with how how to contribute on GitHub, check out [this](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/main/README.md). These instructions are inspired by this repo.

## Apply the same steps from 'first contributions' to this repo.

## Add your name to the 'GroupMembers.md' file.

Once you've added your name to the file, commit the changes with the following:

```bash
git add GroupMembers.md
```

```bash
git commit -m "your message goes here"
```

Push your changes to Github

```bash
git push -u origin new-branch-name-goes-here
```

Then go to your GitHub repo and add a pull request. Once this is done, I will merge the changes.

#### These are the steps that we'll follow throughout the semester to complete this project together.

1. Always make sure you are using the most up to date repo and a new branch before making any changes.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

```bash
git switch -c new-branch-name
```

2. Once you are done with the changes, make sure you are in the correct branch then do the following.

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "detailed changes"
```

```bash
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```

3. Go to your GitHub repo, and submit the pull request.

4. When starting a new change, go to step 1, and repeat.
